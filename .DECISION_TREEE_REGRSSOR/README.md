## # Decision Tree Regression ‚Äì Streamlit App

This project demonstrates how to use **Decision Tree Regression** to predict salaries (or any continuous variable) based on input data.

It includes an **interactive Streamlit web app** that allows users to upload their dataset, train the model, and visualize predictions instantly.

### **About the Project**

The **Decision Tree Regression** model splits data into branches to make non-linear predictions.

This app provides:

* CSV file upload support
* Feature and target column selection
* Real-time prediction for custom inputs
* Interactive visualization of model results

#### **Tech Stack**

* Python üêç
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* Streamlit

##### git clone https://github.com/Ashokux117/DECISION_TREE_REGRESSOR_MODEL-app.git

cd decision-tree-regression-app

###### How to run

run the streamlit app
